# Project 3
# SVM_model

# Project Structure:
### Task 1: Understanding the concept of building a Support Vector Machine classification algorithm with a real-world example.
### Task 2: Importing and exploring the dataset and importing needed libraries: numpy, pandas and matplotlib.
### Task 3: Splitting the dataset into training set and testing set.
### Task 4: Applying feature scaling to normalize the input features.
### Task 5: Fitting the SVM classifier to the dataset and making predictions.
### Task 6: Visualizing training and testing sets results.



## Support Vector Machine for Classification
### Now we will build SVM algorithm in Python with classification. We will accomplish it in by completing each task in the project:
* Introduction â€“ Understanding the goal of our project
* Importing our dataset and needed libraries
* Splitting the dataset (Train and Test)
* Feature Scaling for normalization
* Fitting our model and making predictions
* Building the Confusion Matrix
* Visualizing the results

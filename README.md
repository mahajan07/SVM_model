# Project 3
# SVM_model

# Project Structure:
### Task 1: Understanding the concept of building a Support Vector Machine classification algorithm with a real-world example.
### Task 2: Importing and exploring the dataset and importing needed libraries: numpy, pandas and matplotlib.
### Task 3: Splitting the dataset into training set and testing set.
### Task 4: Applying feature scaling to normalize the input features.
### Task 5: Fitting the SVM classifier to the dataset and making predictions.
### Task 6: Visualizing training and testing sets results.
